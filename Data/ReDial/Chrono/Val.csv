I haven't heard of that movie, what is that movie about? And also, who is in it? It doesn't sound funny, but it is. It was written by this comic and his wife and is a true story about how they met. Basically, they started dating, and he was kind of a jerk, and they broke up, but right after that, she got really sick and was put into a medically induced coma. She hadn't taken his name off of her medical emergency list and he gets called. While he is at her bedside, her parents fly into the area. Now, one of the reasons it didn't work out is because they are from two different cultures and he never told his parents, who were trying to arrange a marriage for him, that he was dating someone. Her parents are played by Ray Romano and Holly Hunter. I didn't know the main comic from before, but he is in some show called Silicon Valley and she was in a movie called @97935 I know who you are talking about. Well you definintely sold me on that movie It has such a great storyline, thank you so much!

I heard the newest @205060 is funny too but I haven't seen it yet! I saw the first one and would like to see the newest one. Another good one is @91313 it's funny and a cute movie! That was a really good movie.  My family is blended so it went well. Have you seen @81075 . It was really good. Oh that's great!  I like Adam's newer movies.  @115908 is another good one to see. I have not I haven't seen it.  Thanks for the suggestion. It's really cute!  You should see it! Have you seen @83552 yet?  It was a funny movie I have not seen it. LOL I was just typing that I heard @83552 is a good one too and I want to see it.

On an isolated stretch of land 50 miles outside of San Francisco sits the most haunted house in the world. Built by Sarah Winchester, (Academy Award (R)-winner Helen Mirren) heiress to the Winchester fortune, it is a house that knows no end. Constructed in an incessant twenty-four hour a day, seven day a week mania for decades, it stands seven stories tall and contains hundreds of rooms. To the outsider it looks like a monstrous monument to a disturbed woman's madness.

What kind of romantic comedy, or adult comedy can you recommend for when the kids go to bed? I did love @179618 one of my favorite films! @132728 is an old romantic comedy but both men and women tend to like it. I also recommend @123015 which has some very funny sweet moments in it. @132728  is a sweet classic, what about something a little more recent? Its really hard to find a good movie these days.
