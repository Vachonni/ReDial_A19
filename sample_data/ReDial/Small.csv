I like mysterious movies like @84001 Or movies about drugs and crime like @201231 , or @172109 whoops, I mean @178950 I haven't seen any of them, but I've heard of them all. Have you ever seen @170119 ? It's a pretty decent suspenseful movie Or @196336 ? That's probably my favorite movie that incorporates both drugs and crime Oh, yeah, I haven't seen that since I was a kid. I recently watched @202190 though, super spooky @196336 is iconic, I've heard, it's on my list, haha It's a definite must see! do you enjoy Quentin Tarantino's works? @202190 is a great one too!

419,"Hi! I'm looking for some suggestions for good movies. What would you recommend? Hi, have you seen  @170119 ? I enjoy pretty much any movie. But I really like suspenseful movies I was actually just going to mention that. I love @170119 The ending was ruined for me the first time I watched it but I still really enjoyed it It was a good movie I thought. Another good movie was @137985 I've never seen that one. What's it about? Good action and great story. It has Jeff Bridges in it. Sounds good! I enjoy most action movies too as long as there's no Tom Cruise in it What is a good movie you seen lately? LOL!  I am not a big Tom fan at all. I want to see @93013 The only Tom Cruise I liked was @163231 You would love to see @137985 , I really recommend this one. The best movie I've seen recently in @107673 with Will Smith. That was awesome I'll have to check it out! I didn't like @Far and Away. I guess it would be @164311  for me. That actually used to be my favorite movie for a while. But I didn't like him in it all that much Nice chatting with you! You too!
