I'm really enjoying Logan, Wonder Woman and the likes these days Everyone is going to see Black Panther  this weekend. If you like action movies that could be a great choice. You know any good action movies? Sure Dunkirk was pretty good I can't wait to see Justice League Wonder Woman was great and long overdue. What else you got? The John Wick, and John Wick: Chapter 2  are decent I didn't see Justice League or any other Marvel Films. Why not? Not a fan? My husband prefers DC over Marvel Not really a Marvel Fan.  Who stars in John Wick: Chapter 2 ? Keanu Reeves I did like The Matrix . My favorite was The Matrix Reloaded Have you seen Fast & Furious ? Yeah, good movie, though the franchise is getting kind of worn out at this point I hope a The Matrix series is created with the original stars.

Also the new Jumanji that is out was a good one too It is based off a book, I would recommend looking it up. It just came out a few days ago in theatres. Neither have I seen this one as well. Is it a horror movie? No its not a horror movie at all. Its kind of like a &quot;video game&quot; story line but not really. Its hard to explain.

19876,"Hello! Nice to meet you . Hello I really like the movies Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and The Avengers. I really like fantasy and action. What types of movies you like to watch? I do not like horror movies like The Ring. Those are too scary. What about you? That is nice choice. I do suggest watching The Greatest Showman. It is a good movie and I like the music in it. Have you watched Shutter Island I have not seen it. I heard it is scary so I don't think I would like it. Yeah, I will watch it for sure No, that movie is not horror. It is psychological thriller. Ahh I see. I might check it out as long as it is not horror. Thank you for the suggestion. Have you watched Pacific Rim I have not. I have heard of it though. I might watch it too. Thank you for your suggestions. Is there anything else? Yeah, you should watch. It is filled with a lot action and fantasy too.
