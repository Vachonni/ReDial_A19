The Japanese version of this article talks about both Golden Sun titles, instead of just the first title of the series.  Shouldn't both English articles about both titles be merged together? I believe this will help raise the priority.  Also, why not send a translator to find information in the Japanese article that the English one lacks?","[(2,-1), (24,0), (246,1)]"
