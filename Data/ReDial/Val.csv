18399,"Hello! Hi. What are you here for? I'm looking for a good movie. Any genre except for horror. Any suggestions from something you really like? The last very good movie I saw was @205821. It was very heartfelt and funny.  I also saw @182404, which was action packed, and @205698. I also rewatched @106388 and it was just as funny as I remembered. Wow. I haven't seen any of those newer ones. Why did you like @205821? I know the critics gave it pretty good reviews, but some people I know thought it was just okay. Ha, that last one is a classic. I used to watch it when I was little! I think  @205821 felt more like a classic coming of age movie. There weren't any fancy effects, and it was simple, but that's why I liked it. It really stood out among the current movies that all have CGI or overdone plots. That's true. I'll have to see it. It went back to basics, which was really refreshing. I hope I suggested some things you can watch. I recently watched @152322 which is kind of like that. Just simple but a good story. Yes. Thank you! I'll have to watch those. I haven't seen that, I'll check it out. Have a good day! You too!

I'm out of the loop when it comes to those right now I've been a little behind on Drama, admittedly, but I think I've got a few for you. Are you into historical dramas, uplifting dramas? Great! Umm lets go with historical dramas If you're into war films about pragmatic duty with an uplifting ending, @111540 is really good. I will definitely look into it. I haven't even heard of that one! Do you know any good romance movies? I do.  Are you looking for something more recent, because my go-to for Romance is usually Shakespeare? But I can do a recent recommendation. It doesn't matter! Have you watched the @120084 with Leonardo DiCaprio? I liked it but I swear the whole ending where she literally opened her eyes and saw him drink the poison was just crazy lol @120084 is the reason I auditioned for Tybalt last year.  I didn't get it, but I still got a fun part. That's awesome! Okay, romance movies!  If you like Joss Whedon and can do another Shakespearean film (with a happy ending, I promise), look into @101813 . I will have to look into it. Have you seen any good ones on Netflix? The only thing I didn't like about it was that the black and white film and the costume choice made it hard to differentiate characters, but I still loved it. Okay, Netflix... I admit I've been neglecting my Netflix for a while, but I'll see what I can jog up. Haha that's fine! If you can just think of any other it might be on there. Groovy.  :) How does Woody Allen suit you?  Because I'm thinking @157711 . I love him! I've seen part of that one but will have to look into it more. Thanks so much for the suggestions! It's about a man who goes back to 1920s Paris and mingles with the artists of the time, which helps him cope with his 20th century obligations.  It also asks the question &quot;When were the good old days&quot;. Sweet!  I'm glad I could help.

7837,"Hello. How is your night going? Hi.  It's going great in Kentucky.  How is your evening? I'm here to help you find a movie or two. If that is what you would like. I'm trying to find some movies I'm not familiar with. My movie interested have sort of turned into tunnel vision with Marvel and Star Wars. Absolutely another movie outside of those story arcs is perfect. For example I watched @169419  and @155829  recently and that is really it for movies that I've seen in the last few months. LOL, yes there are so many Sci Fi's out there.  I can help you find a comedy or a horror.  Will either of those work for you? Yes. I love horror movies. For example @204644 was really good.  It was a bit chilling but it left me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen. Is that the movie where there is something like a ghost pursuing the family? I haven't seen it but I've been around other people watching it. @202190 ng is a great classic with Jack Nicholson.  I don't think there is any movie that is any scarier. That's a great suggestion. I will definitely watch that one. No, The Mother is about a couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence. It gets pretty hairy at time because of jealousy I see. That sounds interesting too. I will watch both of those. Sounds great.  I'm glad you liked the recommendations.  Goodbye Thanks for your help.

I feel like I've seen the star of that somewhere, but I couldn't place him I like a variety of things.

I keep seeing the ad for that. I did like @81135 ,  seems similar I will check that out.  Thank you. I also want to see @205557 I saw @205557, it is pretty okay. But not something I would pay to see at the movies maybe more or dvd. But if you like spy movies I would say go for. Though @134885 series is better, and it is the same director It always seems like a risk at theaters recently I am more willing to wait than I used to be So many ways to watch now Get movie pass, it helps! I need to finish The Hunger Games series.  I forgot where I left off.  Thank you. I'll look into the movie pass too. About $10 a month? Yep, it is a great way to save money and it lets me see movie I would normally wait until dvd to see like @205695 or @205435 Good call.  I'll consider that.  Thanks a lot! Have a wonderful day.

Because its a prequel and doesn't deal with the primary timeline from the first film The best of the franchise in my opinion is @89659 it explains more of the backstory of the blood fued between the two races I see.

And one last one, also related to @203424 is @108137 Yes, I saw that, it was good. Oh, good. Glad you liked it. Lastly, I recommend @152153. Old thriller by Spielberg.

1181,"hello Hi there! okay so I am supposed to ask for a movie suggestion. I really like good action films, comedy, romance, and I also enjoy family movies with my family lol Sounds like you're into a bit of everything. :) Any preference for time period? Not really it just all depends if the plot sounds good Since you like family oriented comedy, I'll suggest a few of my favorites of Bill Murray. Can't go wrong with @136983 and @178715 . Though Murray only does a voice over in the second choice. Both are good movies in fact I own  @TheJungleBook and I have seen @136983 many times OH okay. Great then! What about @87674 or @190543 ? They lean a little more to the adult in terms of theme, but are good in my opinion. I haven't seen either of those but I will definitely have to check them out. The titles sound interesting I'm really fond of the second. Scarlet Johansson is in it. It's about 2 people who meet in Tokyo to produce a commercial but find love and solace in one another. And while we're on the subject of love, @189349 starring Joaquin Phoenix is another good one sounds pretty good. I will definitely have to check them out. Thanks :) I do like Joaquin Phoenix. I will have to look that one up too Coincidentally it also stars Johansson but she only does a voice over of his love interest. oh ok Guess that about covers it. Need any more suggestions? nope i am good thanks again Alright, I hope you have a great time watching those. :)","[(523, 1), (3026, 1), (4477, 1), (5401, 1), (5150, 1), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0)]"

I really wanted to smack Gaylord in that one. He could have avoided a lot of problems if he just stopped lying! One of my favorite parts was when he said that he milked a cat. How about @177764 ? I don't think this one is as funny but it's kind of like a fairytale if you're into romance. That was truly horrifying, haha! I agree.  @177764 isn't quite as comical.

Is that @108934 ? yes I do like superhero movies. Trust me, this is a great movie to watch Would you recommend @114756 ? I have not seen that one yet. Yes, Iron Man was another great movie as well. What is your favorite superhero movie to recommend? I really liked @99583 I also enjoyed @119149  Hancock is my favorite superhero movie. What did you like about it? I enjoyed the special effects in @99583 I liked how his character was throughout the movie. He seemed nonchalant, yet confident. @83948  sounds like it is worth checking out. Yes indeed. I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't to be honest. I do enjoy movies with interesting characters and settings. Hancock and Thor both have that. One of the things I liked best about @119149 was the part set during WWII. I haven't seen that one... My grandfather was at Anzio, so I find seeing the war in movies interesting. That's amazing!

Is there any particular interest you have in a Disney movie so that I can pair you with one best fit for you? I like to sing along so good music is a must Great! I know many people enjoy @135250 as a classic disney film which features many song tracks to sing along to! I did see that one, but it's been a long time. And I remember the music was good. Let's keep thinking, but keep that as a maybe. It has been a while since it's original release. If you're interested in a more modern one, @82894 has been especially popular with fans of disney soundtracks! I really enjoyed that. But we've seen it a lot. I am looking for something I don't already have memorized. We also really enjoyed @188780 Sure, no problem! Are you looking for something more modern then, like Tangled? Or a classic? Because if it's classic and something I'm sure isn't too memorized, I can suggest @115548 as Walt DIsney's third major disney film! It's mainly about Mickey Mouse and includes a wide range of classical tracks! However, if something like @188780 is more of your taste, I highly recommend @122604.

The soldiers are in pursuit of the Pict leader, and Quintus joins their quest. Soon afterward, the Romans’ Pict guide betrays them, resulting in the slaughter of all but a handful of men. The Roman survivors try desperately to reach safety, as the indigenous warriors pick them off one by one.&quot; http://onlinefanatic.com/similar-movies-like-gladiator-and-300/ No. I haven't seen it, but I do want to see that one.

I know it's a popular one Yes, for a party with an 80's theme I can think of a lot of movies. @135485 movies are fun to watch in a group. Yes, that's a great one! The @82602 is a classic flick to watch too. You're good at this! Thank you! Have a great day, bye. You too!","[(1799, 1), (5123, 1), (2123, 1), (866, 1), (3451, 1), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0)]"
